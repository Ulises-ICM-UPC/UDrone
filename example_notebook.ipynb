    "`UDrone` is an open source software written in Python for automatic calibration of drone video images from a set of manually calibrated frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The calibration algorithm assumes that the intrinsic camera parameters remain unchanged while the extrinsic parameters (position and orientation) vary. The result of the process is the common intrinsic camera parameters for all images and the extrinsic parameters for each individual images extracted from a video. In addition, planviews can be generated for each image. The development of this software is suitable for processing videos obtained from moving cameras such as those acquired from drones. Details on the algorithm and methodology are described in\n",
